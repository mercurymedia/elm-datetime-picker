`dateStringFn` - a function that returns a string representation of the selected day

{-| Set the visibility of the timepicker in the `DateTimePicker`

`NeverVisible` - The time picker is never visible. Please note that
while ostensibly picking a day, a selection still returns a Posix
representing the beginning of that day (00:00). It is up to you to
process the selection accordingly if you wish to treat it as a whole day.

`Toggleable` - The time picker visibility can be toggled but
is by default closed when the datetime picker is opened. Additional
configuration can be achieved via `TimePickerSettings`.

`AlwaysVisible` - The time picker is always visible. This is the default setting
as it most explicitly shows that the datetime picker is indeed picking both
a date and time, not simply a date. Additional configuration can be achieved
via `TimePickerSettings`.

{-| The type facilitating the configuration of the timepicker settings.

`timeStringFn` - a function that returns a string representation of the selected time of day

Because it could be the case that a picker is being used in a different
timezone than the home timezone of the implementor, the `allowedTimesofDay`
function ingests a `Zone` in addition to a `Posix`. The
`Zone` represents the time zone in which the picker is being used. An
implementor can leverage this to compare against a base time zone when
enforcing allowable times of day, etc. You SHOULD assume that the `Posix`
passed into these functions is floored to the start of its respective `Day`.
